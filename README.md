node-media-streamer
===================

A node service which can be used to scan your media library and stream via the web.

The current version uses media-info  to get the data about each media file. This data is then saved to mongodb. 

I will be updating this to use avconv soon.

Required node_modules:

express
mongodb
walk
xml2js

Required software

mediainfo http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en
